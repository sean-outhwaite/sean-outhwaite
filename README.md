## Hello World 👋 🌏

### About Me
I've been learning to code in my spare time over the last few years and recently took the plunge to enroll at Dev Academy Aotearoa. I'm finishing up my time there and am now looking for opportunites to put what I've learnt into practice.

For the past 6 years I've been working as a Product Manager, so I have a good understanding of the SaaS world and product/development practices. I leant more into the technical side of Product so I have plenty of experience with SQL as well as app management tools like Firebase, Play & App Stores, Unleash, and more.

More recently I've been building projects with React, Express, and Typescript - to build on top of my vanilla JS skills.

Check out my pinned repos for some examples of personal projects I've worked on, and if you want to get in touch you can find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sean-outhwaite/) 🤝 or my [email inbox is always open](mailto:sean.outhwaite@gmail.com) 📧

## Currently working on 🧑‍💻

### 🚌 Bussin

This project uses the AT and Google Maps APIs to display live incoming bus locations as well as their ETAs for the bus stop I use most frequently. I got tired of having to pull my phone out, open up the AT app and tap through a few things just to be able to check when the next bus will be, so I started building this so that I could have a live display set up somewhere to view without requiring any interaction.

The web side of things is mostly finished for now, my next steps will be to deploy it somewhere / get it running on a Raspberry PI so that I can display the info in my home.

## Past Projects 🕰️

### 🚘 Roadie

My final group project at Dev Academy - Roadie is an AI powered roadtrip planning app, utilising the Gemini API to recommend stops along the way and the Google Maps API to create a route and render it on a map. We included Auth0 for authentication and a SQLite database so users could save their trips and view them again later. For this project I was also the team’s git lead - reviewing their PRs and providing feedback or highlighting potential improvements.

### 🦢 [Swan Dive](https://sean-outhwaite.github.io/)

My personal/technical blog built with HTML, JS, & CSS - hosted on GitHub Pages. It contains some smaller projects as well as blog posts about things I've worked on or lessons learnt. I'm not updating the app itself too much anymore but am continuing to add blog posts, so if you wanted to know more about me it's a great place to start!
