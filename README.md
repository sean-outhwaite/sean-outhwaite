## Hello World 👋 🌏

I've been learning to code in my spare time over the last few years and recently took the plunge to enroll at Dev Academy Aotearoa. I'm finishing up my time there and am now looking for opportunites to put what I've learnt into practice.

For the past 6 years I've been working as a Product Manager, so I have a good understanding of the SaaS world and product/development practices. I leant more into the technical side of Product so I have plenty of experience with SQL as well as app management tools like Firebase, Play & App Stores, Unleash, and more.

More recently I've been working with React, Express, and Typescript - to build on top of my vanilla JS skills.

Check out my pinned repos for some examples of personal projects I've worked on, and if you want to get in touch you can find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sean-outhwaite/) 🤝 or my [email inbox is always open](mailto:sean.outhwaite@gmail.com) 📧
